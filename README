This is the start of the Thesaurus Builder/Navigator.  The architecture is a simple Inverted Index implementation that stores for any given concept, related concepts and how they are related.

UI is still up in the air as is how the QP and this will interface.  JMS would be easy as would web services although the latter could be slower.

Persistence is accomplished through normal Java serialization just in case we want to save our index once it is built and have a back-up.

mutest is a persisted version of the spec example TBN.
